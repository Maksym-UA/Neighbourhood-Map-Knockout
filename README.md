# Neighbourhood Map

## One page app

This project is a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood, places I like to visit. The locations are
shown on [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) map with help of markers and are 
aslo listed in the side view panel. Additional information about each locations is fetched with help 
of [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). The app uses [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/index.html) 
framework to handle filtering and listing.

  
## SETUP

- You'll need to use any web browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html), 
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/new/) or [IE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/result.aspx?q=internet+explorer#nav-downloads). 
- Then just open the app in the browser you like. 


### Modification

- You are free to make changes to the source code. All the necessary libraries are already placed in `js/lib` directory. 
Simply download all the files from the repository and you are ready to go.
- If you are not familiar with Knockout I recommend to go through their [tutorials](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/)

	
### Building your own app

- Should you wish to start a project on your own, you'll need to create new account and new project at [GoogleAPIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) provides good documentation to create awesome projects.
- If you also decide to use [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) in your app, you will have to sign up and create new [app](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps)


### That's it you are ready to go! Feel free to make any changes to the provided code.
